@mainpage Arduino Library Header to access the MAX31855 thermocouple 

@section MAX31855_intro_section Description

Class definition header for the Maxim MAX31855 Cold-Junction Compensated Thermocouple-to-digital converter. The 
MAX31855 datasheet is located at https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX31855.pdf and describes the 
relatively simple interface.  The MAX31855 uses SPI to communicate and only outputs data. It writes a sentence
of 32 bits which include devices failure information and the ambient temperature as well as the thermocouple probe
temperature in degrees Celsius.\n\n

The most recent version of the MAX31855 library is available at https://github.com/SV-Zanshin/MAX31855 and the
documentation of the library as well as example programs are described in the project's wiki pages located at
https://github.com/SV-Zanshin/MAX31855/wiki \n\n

The MAX31855 is a specialized chip that uses SPI to send a sentence of 32 bits on demand. This contains the ambient
temperature and probe temperature in degrees Celsius as well as some status bits indicating fault conditions. It 
does not have any data inputs apart from checking the state of the CS pin.
